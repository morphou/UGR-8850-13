			<div class="col-xl"><p>Unlike the rest of the world, Ethiopian Christmas (Gena) is celebrated on January 7(tahesas 29).The date is not the only differnce between ethiopian christmas and the world's but also the way it is celebrated.Parents spend the night at church , Eldest daughter is responsible for the doro wot, Eldest son for preparing the wood for the doro,younger ones playing "ye gena chewata" and the babies cheering for whom ever they want that is the way an eve is spent in ethiopia.After all the hard work and magic hands of our sisters on the day of christmas everyone gathers around to break a fast of 43 days with an amazing doro wot finishing with coffee as usual, the rest of the day can be used to visit families or just spend a lazy day watching special holiday shows and eating doro wot.So for Ethiopians Red is just a color, tree is something we have in our garden, and eve is a day to do DORO WOT. But recently due to globalization and influence of the westerns in urban areas of the country red has been more than just a color and trees have upgraded themsleves to be member of the livingroom.The problem is not we are taking the westerns culture but that we are losing our own. Look at me for instance, me turning huge trees into pieces of wood lmao its christmas eve and i am here writing a blog.Nevertheless the latest design of semha for outsiders' christmas was bomb.It was modern,elegent and classy at once.This is what we need to see more of new designs and art works not just prints on shirt or just one successful design for the whole brand.</p></div>
